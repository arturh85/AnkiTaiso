# Documentation System

Project Documentation organised by [The Documentation System](https://documentation.divio.com/).

There is a secret that needs to be understood in order to write good software documentation:
there isnâ€™t one thing called documentation, there are four.

They are: `tutorials`, `how-to guides`, `technical reference` and `explanation`.
They represent four different purposes or functions, and require four different approaches to their creation.

Understanding the implications of this will help improve most documentation - often immensely.
